Introduction
=======

BloomAPI Public Data is a way to programatically access public datasets. It may be used from sites such as <www.bloomapi.com/search> or, as a software developer, it may be queried for use in application development. The documentation below explains how, as a software developer, to use or deploy your own copy of BloomAPI Public Data.

Note that anything marked as *Experimental* in this documentation may be removed without warning in a future release. If you’d like to depend on these features in production, sign up for an account or consider hosting your own copy of BloomAPI Public Data.


API Usage
=======

Calling
---------------

BloomAPI is a http-based API. It can be queried at <http://www.bloomapi.com/api/> or at the url of your own deployment.

``` javascript
 Example 200 Response

 curl -XGET https://www.bloomapi.com/api/search/usgov.hhs.npi
 ```
Experimental JSONP is currently supported by providing a `callback` method through the parameter callback.

All responses are JSON objects with the following parameters.

| Name          | Description
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| meta          | Information related to the query such as number or results or warning messages |
| results       | Payload response such as the data being queried for                            |



 ``` javascript
  { "meta":
    {
      "count": 1923
    },
    "result": [
      {
        "npi": 1111111111,
        "type": "individual"
      }
    ]
  }
```






Errors
---------------
Errors are communicated through http return codes. Codes that are returned by BloomAPI include.

``` javascript
Example 400 Response
```

400 errors also include a JSON response object explaining the cause of the error.

``` javascript

{
  "error:": "Error message",
  "type": "parameter|fatal",
  "details": {
    "some-key": "An object that represents this error type"
  }
}

```

* 400: User error such as invalid parameters.
* 404: API endpoint or entity not found.
* 5xx: Server error. Likely caused by a bug in BloomAPI.



API Key
---------------

Development access at <http://www.bloomapi.com/api> is available without an API key, however, for production access, for https access, or for access to private data sources — an API key is required. Some of the current private datasources include:

* Federal Sanctions List
* PECOS
* Hospital Compare
* ICD-9/10/ Crosswalks
* HCPCS
* FDA NDC
* AHRQ files
* CCLF (Claims and Claims Line Feed)
* If you are interested in datasources such as these or unlimited production access, you’ll need a  BloomAPI Account.

Sign Up to request an API Key.

Once you have an API key, it can be added to any request by adding the parameter secret to any request.

``` javascript
Example Usage of API Key

https://www.bloomapi.com/api/search/usgov.hhs.npi?secret=:api_key_here&key1=practice_address.zip&op1=eq&value1=98101
```

Endpoints
=======

/api/search/:source
------------

Returns search results given a datasource. `:source` should be replaced by the datasource your currently searching (for example, `usgov.hhs.npi`).

### Parameters

``` javascript
  Examples
```

* `key` name of field to filter by. Replace * with any number to set the 'index number’. The index number is used to associate keys with an 'op’ and 'value’.
* `op` search operation to apply for a given index number. Currently supports the following values:
  ..* eq exact match
  ..* gt greater than
  ..* lt less than
  ..* gte greater than or equal
  ..* lte less than or equal
  ..* prefix experimental matches the prefix of the string. Useful for real-time search/ autocomplete.
  ..* fuzzy experimental uses a fuzzy match search. Useful for correcting spelling errors.
* value* value to search for given an index number. String must be uppercase.
* limit optional, sets the maximum number of records to return. Default is 20 and maximum is 100
* offset optional, sets a number of records to skip before returning. Default is 0

``` javascript
  Query for all clinicians that practice in the zipcode ‘98101’

  GET http://www.bloomapi.com/api/search/usgov.hhs.npi?limit=10&offset=0&key1=practice_address.zip&op1=eq&value1=98101

  Query for all clinicians that have a last name of 'Dennis’ and practice in the zipcode '943012302’

  GET http://www.bloomapi.com/api/search/usgov.hhs.npi?limit=10&offset=0&key1=last_name&op1=eq&value1=DENNIS&key2=practice_address.zip&op2=eq&value2=943012302

```


### Response Fields

This depends on the data sources used. See the Data Sources section for a description of fields for a given data source.


/api/sources
------------


Returns the current datasources and their status.

### Response Fields

The result will be an array of data sources.

| Field         | Description
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| source        | Identifier of datasource. The only datasource is 'NPI’ for now              |
| updated       | Timestamp of the last time the datasource was updated                       |
| check         | Timestamp of the last time BloomAPI checked for additional data for this  datasource                                                                                    |
| status        |  Legacy field. Will always `READY`                                          |


/api/sources/:source/:id
------------

Returns a specific element of a particular source. For example, the NPI’s :id would be an NPI to return information for.

```
    Example

    The following would return the details of the NPI 1376954206.
```

``` javascript
  GET http://www.bloomapi.com/api/sources/usgov.hhs.npi/1376954206
```

BloomAPI Public Data is great at loading complex datasets quickly. We also support loading from many other datasources that require private data such as:

* Claims and Claims Line Feed
* AHRQ inpatient/ outpatient/ emergency databases
* HL7v2
* CCDs (HL7v3)

If you’d like access to an API with data from one of the above or would like another datasource to be included, please contact support

DEPLOY
=======

Deploy your own copy of BloomAPI to gain higher performance or high availability to meet your own SLAs. Alternatively deploy it to gain an on-site database containing the most recent copies of datasets such as the NPI.

Note that if you are just looking to setup bloomapi locally — the detailed setup instructions in the Contribute page may be easier to follow. This section is more about deploying BloomAPI in a production environment.

A BloomAPI deployment is made up of four core components

1. API service
1. Data worker/ processor service
3. PostgreSQL (version 9.3)
4. ElasticSearch (version 1.4)

Both the API service and the Data worker are written in Go and can be compiled using the `go install` command. Dependencies in each project are managed using the Godep tool.

Once Go (1.3+) has been installed and configured with a GOPATH, and Godep has been installed, you can clone the repositories using

`go get github.com/untoldone/bloomapi`

`go get github.com/gocodo/bloomnpi`

Once fetched, change into each of the bloomapi/ npi source directory roots and run godep restore.

Run `go install github.com/untoldone/bloomapi github.com/gocodo/bloomnpi` to build the code into your $GOPATH/bin directory. If you are running on a mac, but want to cross-compile for a linux system, you can run make from the bloomapi/ npi source directories. If cross-compiling, the go binaries `gox and gonative` must also be installed and configured.

Once compiled, copy the bloomapi binary from $GOPATH/bin, and config.toml, bootstrap.sql, and drop.sql from the bloomapi source directory to an install directory of your choice. For the bloomnpi binary, copy the binary, config.toml, and the sql directory to a different install directory. Create a data directory in the destination for bloomnpi as well.

Edit both `config.toml` files to point to your postgresql and elasticsearch deployments.

Once compiled and configured, you must bootstrap your environment as follows

`[bloomapi install path]/bloomapi bootstrap`

`[bloomnpi install path]/bloomnpi bootstrap`

`[bloomnpi install path]/bloomnpi fetch`

`[bloomnpi install path]/bloomnpi search-index`

This will download and index available datasources.

It will likely make sense to add fetch and search-index as a cron job to ensure your datasets are updated on a regular basis.

Finally, to start the api, run `bloomapi server`. This will start the server on the port specified in your config.toml file.
